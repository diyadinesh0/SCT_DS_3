# Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier

## Objective
To build a Decision Tree classification model to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral attributes.

## Dataset
- Bank Marketing Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle
- Target Variable: `y` (yes/no)

## Methodology
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets
4. Training a Decision Tree Classifier
5. Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Conclusion
The Decision Tree model was able to learn patterns from customer data and predict subscription outcomes with reasonable accuracy.
